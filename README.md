Date calculations based on business calendars.

## Documentation

To get business, simply:

```bash
$ gem install business
```

### Getting started

Get started with business by creating an instance of the calendar class,
passing in a hash that specifies with days of the week are considered working
days, and which days are holidays.

```ruby
calendar = Business::Calendar.new(
  working_days: %w( mon tue wed thu fri ),
  holidays: ["01/01/2014", "03/01/2014"]    # array items are either parseable date strings, or real Date objects
)
```

`extra_working_dates` key makes the calendar to consider a weekend day as a working day.

A few calendar configs are bundled with the gem (see [lib/business/data]((lib/business/data)) for
details). Load them by calling the `load` class method on `Calendar`. The
`load_cached` variant of this method caches the calendars by name after loading
them, to avoid reading and parsing the config file multiple times.

```ruby
calendar = Business::Calendar.load("weekdays")
calendar = Business::Calendar.load_cached("weekdays")
```

If `working_days` is missing, then common default is used (mon-fri).
If `holidays` is missing, "no holidays" assumed.
If `extra_working_dates` is missing, then no changes in `working_days` will happen.

Elements of `holidays` and `extra_working_dates` may be
eiter strings that `Date.parse()` can understand,
or YYYY-MM-DD (which is considered as a Date by Ruby YAML itself).

```yaml
holidays:
  - 2017-01-08  # Same as January 8th, 2017
```

### Checking for business days

To check whether a given date is a business day (falls on one of the specified
working days or working dates, and is not a holiday), use the `business_day?`
method on `Calendar`.

```ruby
calendar.business_day?(Date.parse("Monday, 9 June 2014"))
# => true
calendar.business_day?(Date.parse("Sunday, 8 June 2014"))
# => false
```

### Custom calendars

To use a calendar you've written yourself, you need to add the directory it's
stored in as an additional calendar load path:

```ruby
Business::Calendar.additional_load_paths = ['path/to/your/calendar/directory']
```

You can then load the calendar as normal.

### Business day arithmetic

The `add_business_days` and `subtract_business_days` are used to perform
business day arithmetic on dates.

```ruby
date = Date.parse("Thursday, 12 June 2014")
calendar.add_business_days(date, 4).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")
# => "Wednesday, 18 June 2014"
calendar.subtract_business_days(date, 4).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")
# => "Friday, 06 June 2014"
```

The `roll_forward` and `roll_backward` methods snap a date to a nearby business
day. If provided with a business day, they will return that date. Otherwise,
they will advance (forward for `roll_forward` and backward for `roll_backward`)
until a business day is found.

```ruby
date = Date.parse("Saturday, 14 June 2014")
calendar.roll_forward(date).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")
# => "Monday, 16 June 2014"
calendar.roll_backward(date).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")
# => "Friday, 13 June 2014"
```

To count the number of business days between two dates, pass the dates to
`business_days_between`. This method counts from start of the first date to
start of the second date. So, assuming no holidays, there would be two business
days between a Monday and a Wednesday.

```ruby
date = Date.parse("Saturday, 14 June 2014")
calendar.business_days_between(date, date + 7)
# => 5
```

### Included Calendars

We include some calendar data with this Gem but give no guarantees of its
accuracy.
The calendars that we include are:

* Bacs
* Bankgirot
* BECS (Australia)
* BECSNZ (New Zealand)
* PAD (Canada)
* Betalingsservice
* Target (SEPA)
* TargetFrance (SEPA + French bank holidays)

## But other libraries already do this

Another gem, [business_time](https://github.com/bokmann/business_time), also
exists for this purpose. We previously used business_time, but encountered
several issues that prompted us to start business.

Firstly, business_time works by monkey-patching `Date`, `Time`, and `FixNum`.
While this enables syntax like `Time.now + 1.business_day`, it means that all
configuration has to be global. GoCardless handles payments across several
geographies, so being able to work with multiple working-day calendars is
essential for us. Business provides a simple `Calendar` class, that is
initialized with a configuration that specifies which days of the week are
considered to be working days, and which dates are holidays.

Secondly, business_time supports calculations on times as well as dates. For
our purposes, date-based calculations are sufficient. Supporting time-based
calculations as well makes the code significantly more complex. We chose to
avoid this extra complexity by sticking solely to date-based mathematics.
